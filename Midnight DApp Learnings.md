Midnight DApp Development Learnings
Switching Network Config (Testnet to Undeployed/Local)

• Proof Server: Stop the Testnet container and start the local one using `docker-compose -f standalone.yml up`.

• Scripts: Use the local start script (likely `npm run start` or `start-local`) instead of `testnet-remote-ps`.

• Code: If manually configuring, update `NetworkId` to `NetworkId.Undeployed`.

Funding the Wallet

• Testnet[not used]: Copy the address `mn_shield-addr...` generated by the CLI and use the Midnight Testnet Faucet(https://midnight.network/test-faucet).

• Undeployed: Local environments usually have a different funding mechanism or pre-funded accounts.

Troubleshooting

• "Timed out trying to connect": This usually means the Proof Server is not running or accessible.

• Fix: Run the Proof Server manually in a separate terminal:

```

docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightnetwork/proof-server -- 'midnight-proof-server --network testnet'

```
